## Introduction

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. This repository documents the core concepts and algorithms I've studied.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
Learning with labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning  
Finding hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Learning through interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties.
